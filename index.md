**Update(s):** Midterm 1 will cover everything up to (but not including) functions in Lecture 6. After talking to people who've taken this class before, there might be a mix of 
* "What is the output" questions
* "Write some code that fits the specs" questions
* Multiple choice questions

However, this quarter's format *may* be different.
